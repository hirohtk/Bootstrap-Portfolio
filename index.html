    columns, but container is
    predefined dimensions which I can't work with>-->

                    Born in Hawaii, Kensen moved to the greater Seattle area in 2008 to attend UW Seattle for
                    undergraduate
                    studies. While there, he became acclimated to a diverse group of friends that he would not have
                    otherwise met while still living in Hawaii. These friends were from all across the globe, including
                    India, Korea, Singapore, and Japan. Of course, he would meet local Washingtonians who he still keeps
                    in
                    touch with today.
                    <br><br>
                    Academically, Kensen obtained a BS Degree in Biochemistry from the UW. Currently a sales engineer
                    for
                    lab scale tangential flow membrane research equipment, he enjoys consulting with customers to
                    explore
                    best fits for their needs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most recently, he has developed an interest in web design/development in hopes of being able to
                    create
                    webpages and web apps which are currently lacking in his industry, so that better resources can be
                    used
                    to help others that follow similar lines of work. He is currently developing ideas for final
                    project(s)
                    that can be marketed and one day produce personal revenue.
                    <br><br>
                    His non-professional interests include playing badminton, bike riding, listening to the latest in
                    the
                    EDM genres of trance, drum and bass, and bass music.
